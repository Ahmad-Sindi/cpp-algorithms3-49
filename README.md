**Algorithm Challenge – Level 3 | #49**
**Find Client by Account Number (C++)**
--
**🧮 Problem Description**
--
This challenge demonstrates how to search for a specific client record inside a text file using a unique identifier (Account Number).

Each client is stored as a single line in the file, and the program scans the file to locate the matching record.

**🔧 Algorithm Workflow**
--
📂 Open the client file automatically

📤 Read the file line by line

🔍 Parse each line using the #//# delimiter

📦 Store data inside ClientStructData

🔎 Search sequentially for a matching account number

🪪 Display the client card if found

**💡 New Programming Concept**
--
**Sequential Search (Linear Search)** 
A simple and reliable searching technique used when data is stored in files or unsorted collections.

**📂 Important File Note**
--
⚠️ The client file used in this program exists on **my local machine**.
Anyone applying this idea must:

Create their own text file

Ensure correct file name or path

Have read permissions available

The file is opened **automatically by the program** no manual file opening is required.

**📂 File Information**
